# To Do
Things to do in the various stages of the development

# R&D
The plan is to first make sure that thr interrupts work by lighting up a led in the MCU the immediately understand how to use the USB so that all the rest of the Development is easier. So in the end after asserting that the idea is right whe immediately work on the USB and then we actually work on the keyboard.

## Software
- [ ] Basic Functions --> Matrix, Pressing button
- [ ] Layers
- [ ] Caps Lock lights up Led
- [ ] USB Data
- [ ] Light up Led when powered --> see if more useful to do it HW

## Hardware
- [ ] Buy Parts
    - [ ] Part 1
    - [ ] Part 2
    - [ ] ...
- [ ] Build a Prototipe
- [ ] Power MSP432 thought USB 

## Testing
- [ ] Test all keys
- [ ] Test layers
- [ ] Test Led

# Final Product
- [ ] PCB
    - [ ] Add the power from thew USB
- [ ] Build PCB
- [ ] Final Testing
- [ ] Readme

# Delivery
- [ ] Pitch video
- [ ] Presentation
